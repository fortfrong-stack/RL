# Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate that only source/config files were modified, so no .gitignore rules are needed

# Source files and documentation that were modified
# CHECKLIST.MD - documentation file
# rl/training.py - Python source file

# No build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files detected in changes
# Therefore, no additional ignore rules are required
